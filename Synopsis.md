# Online Food Ordering and Management System

## Objective
The "Online Food Ordering and Management System" is a Database Management System project designed to streamline ordering food online, where customers can see the list of food items and make orders. The project aims to create an efficient and user-friendly platform for customers, providing a seamless experience to manage orders, menus, payments, deliveries, and feedback while ensuring security, scalability, and compliance.

## Scope
The scope of the food order system database includes facilitating online menu browsing, order placement and efficient order and delivery management for enhanced customer experience and streamlined restaurant operations.


## Project Description
The software to be produced is an Online Food Management System. Here, there are two users. They are the admin and the customer. The main procedure is the registration/login of the customer using the website. The admin can manage menus, search orders by order ID, modify food categories and look up registered users. The admin can also look at the reports of orders. Customers can log in, register, browse different menu options, and filter the menu by categories. They can put items in the cart and order. All the information will be entered into the system. There will be a feature to send feedback to the admin. Since all the data will be stored in the database, customers can make payments on the website and view their previous orders and payments. The Online Food Management System efficiently caters to both admin and customer needs, providing seamless registration, menu browsing, ordering, and payment features, all while ensuring easy management and reporting for the admin.
